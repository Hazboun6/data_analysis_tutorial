# Data Analysis Tutorial
This is a fairly generic tutorial for teaching basic frequentist and  bayesian inference.
The parameters are set for a gravitational wave signal, but the beyond that the worksheet is generic.

This worksheet is based on the Pulsar Timing Array [data analysis worksheets](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school) developed for the PTA collaboration NANOGrav.
